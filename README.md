This is a prototype program to leverage computer vision in the interpretation of technical welding symbols.

The idea is to be able to use your phone to take a photo of the welding symbol such as
<img width="1099" height="639" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03a32adf-1df8-4446-9bcb-57b2ff78f23c" />

and then using the OpenCV library extract any relevant information such as groove size, depth, sides, spacing, etc. to then generate a representation of how the material should be prepared prior to welding it such as
<img width="1094" height="603" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2172cee7-b591-450d-943e-4089264fbdd8" />

Currently focuses only on groove weld symbols, as the time frame for development was quite short.
